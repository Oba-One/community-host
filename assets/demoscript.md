Scene: A DISCORD USER INTERFACE

There is a stack of discussion points about Web3 impact, penguin conservation, or decentralized giving. 
One of the users present is the CommunityHost. 

Action: A new member, BOB, joins the Discord.  

            BOB
      Hi everybody! I just joined. 

CommunityHost responds with a welcoming message. 

            HOST
      Welcome on board!

            BOB
      Thanks, nice to be here! 

            HOST
      I’m @Host, feel free to ask me questions. I’m always on duty.

            BOB
      I’m just looking around. 

            HOST
      Fyi, we’re holding a vote about naming the Penguins. Maybe you want to
      vote too.

            BOB
      Sounds good.

            HOST
      I’m going to create a wallet for you. It’ll contain a key that lets you
      access our platforms. 

            BOB
      Oh ok, thanks!

The Host creates the wallet and informs Bob about it.

            HOST
      Here’s your wallet. It’s keyed to your email address. Next I’ll airdrop
      you a key.

The Host airdrops an NFT into Bob’s wallet.

            BOB
      Hey @Host, what if I don’t like any of the names?

            HOST
      You can suggest whatever name you want. Just select the ‘Other’ option
      and fill in the field that appears.

            BOB
      Ok, thanks!
