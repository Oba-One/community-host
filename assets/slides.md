#### Lighting the Way for New Members
&nbsp; 

# Problem: Onboarding into communities is complex
- When new members join an org there’s a big learning curve.
- Especially for newbies it can be technically daunting.
- DAOs typically have a software stack with multiple components:
- Telegram, Discord, Charmverse, Discourse, guild.xyz, Snapshot, etc.
- All these platforms require registration and account configuration. 

# Introducing Community Host!

- Community Host recognizes and greets new members of a community.
- It helps onboard new members, acting as a knowledgeable guide. 
- The Host suggests actions to take such as registering for apps.
- Then it provides advice on how to complete the task. 

# Our Host knows the entire ecosystem
