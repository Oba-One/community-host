## The Lore of the Fireflies

It turns out the Fireflies have been signaling us for thousands of years.
We just didn’t know how to answer. Now that we can communicate we’re learning
a lot. We realize that, in terms of the planetary ecosystem, we’re the newbies.
Like all newbies, we’ve made a lot of mistakes. Now the Fireflies are helping
us onboard and become regenerative citizens.

In collaboration with the Fireflies we trained an AI model on their lore.
It goes back millions of years. Now that AI is spawning instances like
CommunityHost, which helps new members onboard into our micro-biome.

Other communities can invite a CommunityHost to join, train it on their content,
and it’ll use its knowledge to help onboard new members. The Fireflies are
really good at it.
