# Community Host
## Overview
Community Host is an AI agent. It plays a welcoming and assistive role, much like the concierge of a hotel, paying special attention to new members who’ve come onboard in the network. 

## Description
When new members join an organization the onboarding process is usually complex. New members often need to have accounts on the typical apps of the DAO stack, e.g. Discord, Charmverse, Discourse, guild.xyz, Snapshot, etc. Especially for non-techie types the process can be daunting. The Community Host will advise new members about where to register and how to configure their settings. The Host will also answer general questions about the organization, upcoming events, its ideology, and its infrastructure.
