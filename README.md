# Community Host
## Overview
Community Host is an AI agent. It plays a welcoming and assistive role, much like the concierge of a hotel, paying special attention to new members who’ve come onboard in the network. 

## Description
When new members join an organization the onboarding process is usually complex. New members often need to have accounts on the typical apps of the DAO stack, e.g. Discord, Charmverse, Discourse, guild.xyz, Snapshot, etc. Especially for non-techie types the process can be daunting. The Community Host will advise new members about where to register and how to configure their settings. The Host will also answer general questions about the organization, upcoming events, its ideology, and its infrastructure.

## How It’s Made

The **Greenpill onboarding bot** is an **AI-driven assistant** designed to seamlessly onboard users into **regenerative Web3 communities**. Built using **ElizaOS**, it leverages **xAI’s LLM API** for context-aware responses and **AgentKit** to enable on-chain interactions on **Base EVM**. The bot operates directly within **Discord channels**, providing an interactive onboarding experience.  

We also **intend to experiment with different LLMs** to optimize response accuracy, engagement, and adaptability. Our goal is to evaluate various models for **efficiency, alignment with Web3 values, and contextual awareness**, ensuring the best experience for Greenpill community members.
